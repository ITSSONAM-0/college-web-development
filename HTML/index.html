    <h1>What is HTML</h1>
    <p>
        HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> and is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It's a markup language, <i>not a programming language</i>, meaning it uses tags and elements to define how web pages are structured and displayed by web browsers. HTML provides the foundational <u>structure for webpages</u>, organizing elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links to form the content of a website.
